# llmops-observability-platform — project architecture

[README](README.md) · [Interview questions and answers](INTERVIEW_QA.md)

## Purpose and scope

Prompt → model → retrieval → tools → tokens/latency/cost/quality/errors.

This document describes files and symbols in this checkout. Deployment templates and statements in the original overview are distinguished from a verified running environment.

## Component diagram

```mermaid

```

For Python repositories, arrows show resolved local imports, not network calls or deployment order. Otherwise the diagram is a repository component map; containment arrows do not assert runtime integration.

## Components and responsibilities

| Component | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| [`src/plat/main.py`](src/plat/main.py) | HTTP handlers: `GET /healthz`, `POST /check` |
| [`src/plat/gate.py`](src/plat/gate.py) | Functions: `check` |
| [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) | Implementation or supporting configuration |
| [`tests/test_gate.py`](tests/test_gate.py) | Executable checks and regression examples |
| [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) | GitHub Actions job definitions |
| [`README.md`](README.md) | Project explanations or operating notes |

## Request interface

| Method and path | Handler | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /healthz` | `healthz` | [`src/plat/main.py`](src/plat/main.py#L6) |
| `POST /check` | `post_check` | [`src/plat/main.py`](src/plat/main.py#L10) |

The table lists literal route decorators found in the inspected Python modules. Router prefixes and middleware can add behavior; check the linked handler and application setup before calling an endpoint.

## Implementation walkthrough

### `check(body, approved=False)`

Source: [`src/plat/gate.py`](src/plat/gate.py#L1).

Calls visible in this function: `body.get`, `bool`, `failed.append`, `int`.

```python
def check(body, approved=False):
    failed = []

    for key in ("model", "tokens", "latency_ms"):
        if body.get(key) in (None, ""): failed.append(key)
    if int(body.get("tokens") or 0) < 0: failed.append("tokens")
    return {"passed": not failed, "failed": failed, "applied": False, "approved": bool(approved)}
```

## Data flow and design decisions

### What is the input-to-output contract of `check`

In [`src/plat/gate.py`](src/plat/gate.py#L1), `check(body, approved=False)` receives the inputs. The function computes these intermediate values:

- `failed = []`

Its result is defined by:

- `{'passed': not failed, 'failed': failed, 'applied': False, 'approved': bool(approved)}`

### Which decision rules or boundary conditions should an interviewer challenge

The implementation in [`src/plat/gate.py`](src/plat/gate.py#L1) branches on:

- `int(body.get('tokens') or 0) < 0`
- `body.get(key) in (None, '')`

A useful extension is a table-driven test that covers each condition just below, at, and above its boundary where applicable. These expressions are the current rules; changing them changes behavior and should be justified by the project’s acceptance criteria.

## Setup and verification

The following commands are derived from the checked-in dependency/test contracts. Execute them from the repository root; the block prepares a local environment, not a cloud deployment.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pytest -q
```

Python dependencies: [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt).

Test entry points: [`tests/test_gate.py`](tests/test_gate.py).

Automation definitions: [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml). Read their triggers and job steps to determine what CI actually runs.

## Operating boundaries and design review

Before turning this checkout into a customer deployment, establish the input contract, data ownership, access controls, failure response, evaluation criteria, and rollback owner. Repository fixtures and unit tests demonstrate local behavior; they do not establish throughput, uptime, compliance, or business impact.

A useful architecture review starts with the linked implementation: identify where input enters, where a decision is made, which state can change, and which external dependency can fail. Add a deployment view only for infrastructure that is actually configured and exercised.
